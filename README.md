## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various data science techniques, including data visualization, 3D graphing, and data interpolation, using Python. Each notebook is designed to showcase specific skills and methodologies in data science, reflecting the breadth of knowledge from my Ph.D. studies.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Once you have Python set up, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the repository. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the directory and running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once the notebook server starts, you can select the notebook you want to explore from the list.
